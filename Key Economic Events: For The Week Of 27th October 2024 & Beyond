                    1. A specific position exists and there is work available for that position.<br>
                    2. The job could start within 30 days, whether or not the establishment finds a suitable candidate during that time.<br>

                    Investors are closely monitoring the release of Australia's CPI data for Q3.<br><br>
                    During the 2nd quarter, Australian inflation rose to 3.8%, leading markets to dismiss the likelihood the Reserve Bank of Australia would cut interest rates in Q3. As a result, the Australian dollar strengthened, gaining around 2.6% against the euro and 3.6% against the US dollar.<br><br>
                    Bloomberg reports that inflation is projected to drop to 3.5% in Q3, which remains above the 2% target. A larger-than-expected decline could prompt Australian policymakers to consider interest rate cuts, potentially weakening the Australian dollar against other major currencies.

                    China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) provides an early indication each month of economic activities in the Chinese manufacturing sector. It is compiled by China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing (CFLP) and China Logistics Information Centre (CLIC), based on data collected by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).Li & Fung Research Centre is responsible for drafting and disseminating the English PMI report. Every month questionnaires are sent to over 700 manufacturing enterprises all over China. The data presented here is compiled from the enterprises responses about their purchasing activities and supply situations. The PMI should be compared to other economic data sources when used in decision-making.<br><br>

                    A reading that is stronger than forecast is generally supportive (bullish) for the CNY , while a weaker than forecast reading is generally negative (bearish) for the CNY.

                    The markets will closely watch the release of Apple's Q4 earnings report.

                    <br><br>
                    The report may highlight Apple's initiative to incorporate artificial intelligence into its devices, particularly the iPhones launched last September, as well as developers' feedback and the potential of this initiative.

                    Apple's previous quarter earnings per share surpassed expectations of 1.34, reaching 1.40 with a positive growth of 0.14%. For the current quarter, Bloomberg forecasts EPS of 1.59 and quarterly revenues of $94.33 billion.

                    The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) Report on Business is based on data compiled from monthly replies to questions asked of purchasing and supply executives in over 400 industrial companies across the United States. For each of the indicators measured (New Orders, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders, Imports, Production, Supplier Deliveries, Inventories, Customers Inventories, Employment, and Prices), a diffusion index is calculated by adding the percent of positive responses plus one-half of those responding the same (considered positive). The resulting single index number is then seasonally adjusted.

                    <br><br>
                    The PMI is a composite index based on the seasonally adjusted diffusion indices for five of the indicators with differing weights: New Orders --30% Production --25% Employment --20% Supplier Deliveries --15% and Inventories -- 10%.

                    The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) Report on Business is based on data compiled from monthly replies to questions asked of purchasing and supply executives in over 400 industrial companies. For each of the indicators measured (New Orders, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders, Imports, Production, Supplier Deliveries, Inventories, Customers Inventories, Employment, and Prices), this report shows the percentage reporting each response, the net difference between the number of responses in the positive economic direction and the negative economic direction and the diffusion index. Responses are raw data and are never changed.

                    <br><br>
                    The diffusion index includes the percent of positive responses plus one-half of those responding the same (considered positive). The resulting single index number is then seasonally adjusted to allow for the effects of repetitive intra-year variations resulting primarily from normal differences in weather conditions, various institutional arrangements, and differences attributable to non-moveable holidays. All seasonal adjustment factors are supplied by the U.S. Department of Commerce and are subject annually to relatively minor changes when conditions warrant them.

                    <br><br>
                    The PMI is a composite index based on the seasonally adjusted diffusion indices for five of the indicators with varying weights: New Orders --30% Production --25% Employment --20% Supplier Deliveries --15% and Inventories -- 10%.

                    <br><br>
                    The Prices Paid subcategory is a diffusion index calculated by adding the percent of responses indicating they paid more for inputs plus one-half of those responding that they paid the same for inputs. The resulting single index number is then seasonally adjusted.

                    <br><br>
                    The Prices Paid diffusion index is one of a number of indicators pointing to the degree of inflationary pressures in the economy.

                    <br><br>
                    A higher than expected reading should be taken as positive/bullish for the USD, while a lower than expected reading should be taken as negative/bearish for the USD.

                    The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is a diffusion index incorporating survey results provided by manufacturing firms throughout the country. 
                    <br><br>
                    A reading above fifty suggests the manufacturing sector is expanding, while a reading below fifty suggests the manufacturing sector is in contraction. Policymakers and traders watch these surveys closely as purchasing managers usually have early access to data about their company’s performance, rather than waiting for the hard data to emerge. While manufacturing accounts for a far smaller percentage of economic output than services, it is far more cyclical and is therefore a useful indicator of where in the economic cycle the economy is currently situated. A reading that is stronger than forecast is generally supportive (bullish) for the USD while a weaker than forecast reading is generally negative (bearish) for the USD.
