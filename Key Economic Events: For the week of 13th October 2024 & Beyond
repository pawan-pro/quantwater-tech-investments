                    <br><br>It's worth noting that oil prices corrected higher by the end of September and then rallied since the beginning of October - recouping some of its previous losses due to renewed geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. However, in the absence of further escalations, prices may fall once more with the return of Libyan oil to the market and the lack of signs of increased Chinese oil demand.
                    <br><br>If the OPEC report suggests a potential rise in demand, it could lend support to oil prices, which struggle to remain above the $80 per barrel threshold.

                    <br><br>With inflation likely to continue falling, Bloomberg reports that markets have already priced in a 50 basis point rate cut by the New Zealand Central Bank at its November meeting, with an additional 50 basis point cut expected in February next year, with a probability of up to 90%.
                    <br><br>If inflation rises or remains stable around 3%, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand may slow the pace of rate cuts, which could strengthen the New Zealand dollar against other major currencies.

                <span class="event-value">In the UK, YoY CPI held steady in August at 2.2%, while core CPI (excluding food and energy) increased from 3.3% in July to 3.6% in August. As a result, markets expect the Bank of England to cut rates, but more cautiously than its counterparts. Bloomberg suggests that a 25-basis point cut is priced in with over 90% certainity for the November meeting, but only 50% certainity for December. If core inflation remains stable or proves difficult to lower in the September report, investors may delay pricing in a full December rate cut until further data is available, which could strengthen the pound against currencies like the New Zealand dollar.

                <span class="event-value">The European Central Bank (ECB) press conference is held monthly, about 45 minutes after the Minimum Bid Rate is announced. The conference is approximately an hour long and has two parts. Firstly, a prepared statement is read, then the conference is open to press questions. The press conference examines the factors which affected the ECB's interest rate decision and deals with the overall economic outlook and inflation. Most importantly, it provides clues regarding future monetary policy. High levels of volatility can frequently be observed during the press conference as press questions lead to unscripted answers.
